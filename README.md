Alright, so I just stumbled out of the theater after The Electric State, and let me tell you, my brain feels like it's been through a tumble dryer set to crazy futuristic. Have you ever eaten a funnel cake at the fair and then got on the Tilt-A-Whirl? Yeah, multiply that by neon lights and a dash of 80s nostalgia, and there you go.

I came in with a giant bag of expectations, mostly cuz I'd read the book ages ago. It's weird because halfway through munching on my overpriced and soggy popcorn, I realized the movie's basically like if Wall-E decided to drop a mix tape in a techno-apocalypse. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are jaw-dropping—like a Monet painting after dark, or when you accidentally select the wrong filter on your phone, but it somehow works. It draws you in, you know?

But the storyline, man, it took me places... not always in a good way. There are robots, and somehow they feel more human than the humans? I know, I know, I'm supposed to be all deep and introspective, but my mind was bouncing from wow, that's deep to wait, did I leave the oven on?

> Oh, and the main character? She's on a mission or whatever with this quirky robot buddy. I swear, at times it felt like a buddy comedy but soaked in doom and gloom. The pair reminded me of my old farm tractor — reliable but a little creaky around the edges. There's something there, like hope, or maybe just the smell of diesel smoke.

My favorite part? Definitely the tiny things in the background. Tiny details like half-eaten sandwiches in pristine glass cases, seriously. It’s like the director knew I'd zoom in on these oddities, hungry for something real in this electronic wasteland. And then there’s this looming question of ‘Where are we headed?’ Are we just careening towards a future where robots speak in haikus and humanity itself is an afterthought? Makes you think, or maybe that's just the brain fog from lack of sleep.

But hey, say what you will, I’d still suggest you watch the movie, if only to have a shared what-did-I-just-experience moment with friends. Maybe download the movie later and pick apart all those hidden bits. Anyway, it’s been a trip, like watching a lightning storm from your bedroom window—thrilling, unsettling, and you don’t want to look away, just in case you miss something electric.
